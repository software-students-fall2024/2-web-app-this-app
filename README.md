## User stories

For this project, we have decided to only create the student part for the app. Students will be the only user type.
1. As a student, I want to be able to enroll in courses so that I can meet my academic requirements.
2. As a student, I want to drop classes so that I can adjust my course selections based on my academic needs and workload.
3. As a student, I want to check the status of courses so that I can better plan my course schedule.
4. As a student, I want to be able to enroll in a waitlist for a course that I favor so that I can potentially enroll into the class.
